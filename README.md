# Scraping Job Data with Indeed
This is a repository on web scraping indeed job data and output it in a csv format. This is to help me and those needed to easily filter out irrelevant jobs before proceeding to view for further information in the indeed website.

#### Getting Started
1. Fork the repository and extract it into your desired folder.
2. Go to working.py. Replace the phrase showing 'MY USER AGENT' in 'header' with your user agent (Google Search my user agent and copy it).
3. Customize how many you want the scraping result to return and also the url of the jobs you want to look for in the line showing ```# customize here```.
4. Run the working.py file to generate a csv file. You can change the file name in the last line to prevent the csv file from being overriden everytime you run the working.py file.
